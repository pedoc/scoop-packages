    "description": "Arp-ping.exe is an implementation of \"ping\" over arp lookup. It is similar in behavior to the \"arping\" *nix program, but is an independent implementation and works somewhat differently internally. In particular, arp-ping.exe does not require Cygwin to compile nor that there be a packet capture driver (pcap) installed.",
