    "description": "This is md5deep, a set of cross-platform tools to compute hashes, or message digests, for any number of files while optionally recursively digging through the directory structure. It can also take a list of known hashes and display the filenames of input files whose hashes either do or do not match any of the known hashes. This version supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, Tiger, and Whirlpool hashes.",
